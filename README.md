# Reliable Data Transfer
This project implements a reliable data transfer over an unreliable (simulated) link using the stop-and-wait protocol that works even when links have very small packet buffers. The ReliableSocket class (ReliableSocket.h and ReliableSocket.cpp) allows any application thatâ€™s built on top of it to achieve reliable communication, such that transferred files is shown to be byte-for-byte identical copies from sender to receiver. It is able to cleanly shut down connections on both ends, even if packets get lost.
